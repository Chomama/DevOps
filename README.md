This is a really cool article that highlights the increasing investment that the
Pentagon is putting into AI technology.  The Pentagon believes that AI tech has advanced
to the point where it can be effectively implemented within all branches of the
US military.  This is also in response to increased investments into military AI tech
by Russia and China. The pentagon is looking to work with industry leaders including
Google, Oracle, IBM, and SAP.  A unit established in June of last year, called the
Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC for short, believes that commercial
solutions can be applied to military situations and are looking to utilize the
talent within the commercial industry.  The JAIC is forecasted to have a $414 million
dollar budget in 2020.  Ethical issues are of course in the conversation and the
Pentagon recognizes the need for discussion.  The departments Defense Innovation Board
consisting of Silicon Valley advisors is developing a set of ethical principles
for use with AI. For now, there is nothing being developed for autonomous weapons systems,
but there are plans to in the future.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the article. I was *really* interested in Google's decision
to not renew their military contract for Project Maven and to ban use of the AI technology
on developing weapons. This was likely due to the thousands of Google employees that
protested for it. It just goes to show you can company morale can be more important
than the bottom line!
